                In response to the Current Covid 19 crisis, The Florence Veterinary Hospital is currently allowing limited numbers of clients into our building
                to accompany their pets. When you arrive at our office, we ask that you call the office phone number. We will call you back when we are ready for you to enter the building. 
                We ask that you wear a mask to the exam room. We will also collect payment in the exam room. For your safety and ours we are trying to avoid having large numbers of people 
                at the reception desk or in the waiting area. Of course, if you are not comfortable entering our building, we would be happy to come to your vehicle to pick up your pet and 
                return the pet to you after it’s exam. Thank you for your patience with us through the covid 19 crisis.

            </p>
           <p>
                We will keep you informed of any potential changes in protocol through our website or facebook page.
           </p>
           <p>
               I want to reiterate that there is absolutely no known or suspected evidence showing that pets can transfer Covid 19 (Corona) to humans.
               While dogs and cats have their own corona viruses they are not contagious to humans. We will not be able to make house calls until the Covid 19 restrictions are lifted.
               Thank you, Dr Dan Davis

                            The Florence Veterinary Hospital is well known in the Florence area, having been established over 30 years ago.
                            It was moved to its present location in the Fall 2018.  Our former location was just a half mile away on the West side of I-75.
                            The Florence Veterinary Hospital primarily treats small animals.
                        </p>

                            and years of experience in the animal care field.

                            compassion and respect.
