                            The Florence Veterinary Hospital is well known in the Florence area, having been established over 30 years ago.
                            It was moved to its present location in the Fall 2018.  Our former location was just a half mile away on the West side of I-75.
                            The Florence Veterinary Hospital primarily treats small animals.

                            and years of experience in the animal care field.

                            compassion and respect.
