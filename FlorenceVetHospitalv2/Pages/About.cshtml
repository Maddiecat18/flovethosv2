        Their devotion to their patients and empathy for owners make the experiences within the hospital more of a personal relationship than just an exchange of service.*@

                    @*Our policy of scheduling appointments leaves little to no wait time.  We have expanded our waiting area so that pets will not
        feel the stress of crowding should a short wait be required.  The addition of cable television in our waiting room allows our clients
        some entertainment if they wait.*@
