            <p>
                We have partnered with an online pharmacy by the name of VetSsource.  This will give us the opportunity to offer products that we normally don't carry in our office inventory.
                It will give our clients an opportunity to purchase products that come directly from a reliable vendor.
            </p>
            <p>
                These products can be shipped directly to the client's home with pricing that
                beats other online pharmacies.  Not only will our clients get low online price offers, but they will also get the same rebate offers that are available through our office.
            </p>
            <p>
                * Prescriptions will only be filled for patients who are active in our records.
            </p>
