                <b>Alert regarding corona virus</b> As of Thursday March 19, our office has implemented changes in protocol in order to further accommodate our
                clients during the Covid 19 (Corona virus) pandemic.  We will be practicing curbside service only at our office.  This has been working out very well
                and clients and staff have appreciated the safety that this form of measure holds during this uncertain time.  This practice has allowed us to continue
                to help your pets while protecting owners and staff.  When you enter our parking lot, please call our office number 859 371-6501, and we will come out
                to review your pet's needs for that day and bring the pet into our office.  After your pet has received its examination, the doctor will call you with
                a treatment plan.  When your pets treatment is completed, we will bring him/her back to your car.  You never have to leave your car.  We ask that you
                have your pet in a carrier or leashed securely so there are no problems with escapes.  If you don't have a carrier, we can supply you with one when you
                arrive.  It is the owners responsibility to get the pet into the carrier inside the car.  We accept no responsibility for pets that may escape if they
                are not properly restrained before entering the building.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will keep you informed of any potential changes in protocol through our website or facebook page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to reiterate that there is absolutely no known or suspected evidence showing that pets can transfer Covid 19 (Corona) to humans.
                While dogs and cats have their own corona viruses they are not contagious to humans. We will not be able to make house calls until the Covid 19 restrictions are lifted.
                Thank you, Dr Dan Davis
            </p>
